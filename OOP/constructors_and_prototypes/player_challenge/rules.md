# Create a mini-game where the user can create a player that can earn experience points and gain levels. Once the player earns 10 points it gains a level and looses 10 points so that they can start leveling up again.

## Player has a name, a lvl starting at 1 and experience points starting at 0 as attributes. It also has a prototype method to gain experience points after the player wins a fight.
