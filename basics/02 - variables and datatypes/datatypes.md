# There are two types of data types in javascript: primitive and reference type(objects)

## Primitive data types:

    - String - sequence of characters
    - Number - integer or floating-point numbers
    - Boolean - logical entity(true or false)
    - Null - intentional absence of any object value
    - Undefined - a variable that has not yet been defined/assigned
    - Symbol - a built-in object, whose constructor returns a unique symbol
    - BigInt - numbers that are greater than the 'Number' type can handle

## Reference types - these are arrays, Date object and all types of objects

    - you can see a javascript object properties in the console by using 'console.dir(<obj>);'
    - to get a date in javascript you do 'new Date()'
    - for object types you can retrieve their fields with the 'object.field_name' syntax or with the 'object['field_name']' syntax

### Javascript is a dynamically-typed language. This means that you don't have to explicitly define the type of a variable when you create it.

#### The primitive data types are stored in the stack memory and the reference types are stored in the heap memory.
